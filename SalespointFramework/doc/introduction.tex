\chapter{Introduction}
The Salespoint Framework is intended to minimize developing effort of e-commerce solutions and point-of-sale applications.
Salespoint 2010 users complained about complexity, missing features and bugs.
Thus, the decision was made to re-design and re-implement the framework from scratch.
Our development goal was an easy-to-use framework primarily targeted for educational purposes.
As such, Salespoint 2011 is not taylored to any specific application, but designed with a wide area of applications in mind.

Models and design patterns employed in Salespoint 2011 are inspired by ``Enterprise Patterns and MDA: Building Better Software with Archetype Patterns and UML'' by Jim Arlow \,\cite{MDA}.
An overview over the functionality of and new features in Salespoint 2011 is detailed in this document.

We would like to thank all Salespoint users who submitted their feedback and encourage future users of Salespoint 2011 to do the same.
