\section{Spring}
In contrast to earlier versions of the Salespoint Framework, \salespoint{} obeys the MVC pattern. 
\salespoint{} can be seen as the Model of an MVC application, no parts of the View or the Controller are incorporated in the Framework.

\salespoint{} is designed as basis for development of web applications, using the \textit{Spring Framework}~\cite{spring} to implement Views and Controllers.
To further ease the development, \salespoint{} includes property editors to convert string based representations to \salespoint{} identifier types.
Also, JSP tags to check if a user is logged in and if a user has a certain capability are included in the framework.
