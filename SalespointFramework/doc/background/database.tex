\section{Persistence}
The persistence layer was one of the biggest problems in Salespoint 2010. We wanted a solution that acknowledges latitudes for persisting objects with relatively low effort.

Therefore and because of the huge community support, we decided to use the Java Persistence API (JPA). JPA is a Java Programming Language Framework managing relational data in applications. The API itself is defined in the javax.persistence package.

Some of the most popular vendors of JPA are Hibernate and EclipseLink. For developing Salespoint 2011 we used JPA 2.0 with EclipseLink without vendor specific functionality. So it should also be possible to use other JPA 2.0 vendors like Hibernate with this framework.
