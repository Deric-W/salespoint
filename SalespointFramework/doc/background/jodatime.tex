\section{Joda-Time}
Joda-Time is a Java date and time API. It provides a quality replacement for the Java date and time classes. We used this API because the Java Date and Calendar classes are badly designed. Furthermore Joda-Time is very easy to use and provide functionality to handle Java Date and Calendar.
