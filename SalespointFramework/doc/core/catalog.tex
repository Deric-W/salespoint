\subsection{\code{Catalog} - Organizing and presenting \code{ProductTypes}}
If you want to sell your products at your shop, you must presenting them very good to stimulate customers interests. A helpful solution to giving this people a clearly overview could be
a catalog. With the \code{PersistentCatalog}-class, you can implemented such a thing. This class is an implementation of the interface \code{Catalog}.\\
After you created a new catalog, you can add \code{ProductTypes} to it or remove them from it. Also you can checked, whether the catalog contains a defined \code{ProductType}. Aside from you 
this class provides methods to find productTypes by their name or their category at your catalog.\\
In case you have added a \code{ProductType} to the catalog and now you are changing this type, you do not need remove the old type from this catalog and add the new to it. Only you need to 
used the method \code{update(PersistentProductType productType)} from the \code{PersistentCatalog}-class and this \code{productType} will be updated and persist to the \code{PersistentCatalog} 
and the Database.
