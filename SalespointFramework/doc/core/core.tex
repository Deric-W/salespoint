\chapter{\salespoint{} Components}
%This chapter overviews the core functionality of \salespoint and gives a short introduction.
Integrating a persistence layer into the \salespoint{} Framework had a great influence on some design decisions made during development of \salespoint{}.
Early on it became obvious that necessities of JPA could dictate the design and implementations of \salespoint{}.

To guard against the influence of JPA requirements on design decisions, \salespoint{} strongly follows the \textit{programming against interfaces} programming style.
Although, creating an interface for almost every class violates the \textit{KISS} principle, the developers deemed programming against interfaces necessary because \salespoint{} is intrinsically tied to JPA.
Using interfaces allowed us to cleanly define the behaviour of an object, without relying on a specific implementation.
\\

Objects, which need to be persisted to safe the current state of an application, are called persistence entities.
Usually, a persistence entity is a \textit{Plain Old Java Object} (POJO).
Every persistence entity class is an implementation of a corresponding Java interface.
Each persistence entity has a manager class, which in turn is an implementation of a manager interface.
The specific manager implementations in \salespoint{} facilitate persisting the objects to a database.
However, it is possible to implement every persistence entity and manager class in \salespoint{} non-persistent, for example collection-based.
\\

\salespoint{} is designed to be developer-friendly.
A crucial part of its easy-to-use feel is the consistency in interfaces, persistence entities and managers across the framework, including, but not limited to naming of methods and behaviour of managers.
