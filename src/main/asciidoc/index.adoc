[qanda]
Why do I see warning log statements about database tables not being accessible at startup?::
  This is due to a bug in Hibernate in combination with HSQLDB and constraints in databases. Hibernate tries to drop those on application startup but fails to as the (in-memory database) is empty. See https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-9038[this bug report] for reference.
